##What is this?##
A way to create your own simple custom feedback tab.

##Why would I use this over the prebuilt one?##
The prebuilt one is just that, prebuilt, and has zero flexibility outside the parameters you can set in the gui. A lot of customers run into a wall when they want to make very specific tweaks.

##Really? I never needed such customization...##
Move along...
